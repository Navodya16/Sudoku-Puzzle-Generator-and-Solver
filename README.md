first, generate a Sudoku puzzle with randomly distributed numbers. The number of numbers missing in a row or a column can be between 2 to 4.
Hint: A Sudoku puzzle can be generated with all the numbers and then randomly remove the numbers according to the hardness of the puzzle.
Secondly, an algorithm should be developed to solve the Sudoku puzzle generated in the first step according to the rules. If the algorithm place a wrong number on missing cell, it should be indicated. User can decide to start over the solving process or remove the wrong number start the solving process from previous step. User can select how many cells are blank/with missing value in a row or column at the beginning of the programme. Then the puzzle is presented to the user. Once the user issue the command to solve the puzzle, algorithm will automatically fill the missing cells step by step, and each step will be displayed to the user while indicating the newly filled cell
